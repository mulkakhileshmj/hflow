"""``hflow deploy``: emit the DAG bundle for an existing Airflow 3 deployment.

Docker mode (``_bundle``) provisions a runtime; this module targets one the
user already operates -- Astronomer, MWAA, Cloud Composer, or self-managed
(docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Deployment modes", mode 2). ``render_deploy_bundle``
writes plain files and instructions; it makes no API call to any platform.

Output directory contents:

- ``dags/<dag_id>.py`` plus four ``dags/<sub_dag_id>.py`` -- the same five
  ingest DAGs the Compose runtime generates (ONE set of templates in
  ``_templates``): the ingest stage graph's master and its
  sync/meta/labels/media sub-DAGs, rendered against the deployment's data
  root and user-venv
  interpreter instead of the Compose container values -- plus a
  ``dags/.airflowignore`` so platforms that sync ``user/`` inside the dags
  folder never parse the pipeline file in Airflow's own environment.
- ``user/`` -- a copy of the pipeline file (and ``requirements.txt`` when
  supplied), to be placed wherever the platform allows; the DAG finds it via
  the ``HFLOW_USER_DIR`` environment variable (default ``/opt/user``).
- ``DEPLOY.md`` -- concrete instructions: where dags/ and user/ go per
  platform, the ``AIRFLOW__DAG_PROCESSOR__DAG_BUNDLE_CONFIG_LIST`` JSON for
  self-managed deployments (references/airflow3-notes.md, "DAG bundles"), the
  external-python venv's package list, and the environment the DAG expects.

The data root is either an absolute filesystem path every worker sees or a
supported object-store prefix. Object roots use hflow's obstore-backed
spool-through-mirror boundary; workers therefore keep the processing core on
local files without pretending bucket keys have ``pathlib.Path`` semantics.

# Deploying `{dag_id}` to your Airflow 3 deployment

Generated by `hflow deploy` -- re-render instead of editing. No platform
API is called; you place these files with the tools you already use.

## What is in this bundle

- `dags/{dag_filename}` -- the master ingest DAG: it resolves
  the run profile and triggers only the enabled stage sub-DAGs, chained
  sequentially. Trigger conf: `{{"uris": [...], "profile": {profile_names},
  "mode": "batch"|"online", "batch_count": optional int}}`; URIs resolve
  under the data root below. It runs entirely in Airflow's own environment
  and needs `apache-airflow-providers-standard` (bundled with the official
  image and every managed platform) plus a running triggerer (its
  waits are deferrable).
- {sub_dag_list} -- the four stage sub-DAGs the
  master triggers (transform & sync, metadata, labels & artifacts, media).
  Their tasks run in the task venv below.
- `user/{pipeline_filename}` -- your pipeline, imported by the sub-DAGs' tasks.
- `user/requirements.txt` -- your task-venv requirements{"" if requirements_copied else " (not supplied)"}.

## 1. Build the task venv on every worker

Every sub-DAG task runs through `@task.external_python` against
`{config.venv_python_path}`. On every machine that executes tasks, create a
venv at that path and install the base packages plus your requirements
(`virtualenv` must be preinstalled in the venv, and `pendulum` +
`lazy_object_proxy` satisfy the operator's datetime-context probes -- see the
Airflow external-python docs):

```bash
python -m venv {config.venv_python_path.removesuffix("/bin/python")}
{config.venv_python_path.removesuffix("/python")}/pip install {venv_packages}
{requirements_line}
```

If your platform cannot host a venv at that path (managed images differ),
create it wherever the platform allows and re-render with
`--venv-python <interpreter path>`.

## 2. Place `dags/` and `user/`

The DAG loads your pipeline from `$HFLOW_USER_DIR/{pipeline_filename}`
(default `{USER_DIRECTORY_DEFAULT}`), so set `HFLOW_USER_DIR` on all Airflow
components to wherever `user/` lands.

### Astronomer

- Copy the five DAG files in `dags/` into your Astro project's `dags/` folder.
- Copy `user/` into the project's `include/user/` (deployed at
  `/usr/local/airflow/include/user`).
- Set `HFLOW_USER_DIR=/usr/local/airflow/include/user` in the Deployment's
  environment variables, then `astro deploy`.

### Amazon MWAA

- Upload the contents of `dags/` (the five DAG files plus `.airflowignore`)
  to `s3://<your-mwaa-bucket>/dags/`.
- Upload `user/` to `s3://<your-mwaa-bucket>/dags/user/` (MWAA syncs the dags
  prefix to `/usr/local/airflow/dags`; the bundled `.airflowignore` keeps the
  parser away from your pipeline file, which imports task-venv-only packages).
- Set `HFLOW_USER_DIR=/usr/local/airflow/dags/user` (MWAA environment
  configuration, "Environment variables").

### Cloud Composer

- Upload the contents of `dags/` (the five DAG files plus `.airflowignore`)
  to `gs://<your-composer-bucket>/dags/`.
- Upload `user/` to `gs://<your-composer-bucket>/dags/user/` (mounted at
  `/home/airflow/gcs/dags/user`; the bundled `.airflowignore` keeps the
  parser away from your pipeline file, which imports task-venv-only packages).
- Set `HFLOW_USER_DIR=/home/airflow/gcs/dags/user` (Composer environment
  variables).

### Self-managed Airflow 3

- Place the five `dags/*.py` files in a directory readable by the dag
  processor, e.g. `/opt/airflow/dags`, and point Airflow 3's DAG-bundle list
  at it:

```bash
AIRFLOW__DAG_PROCESSOR__DAG_BUNDLE_CONFIG_LIST='{DAG_BUNDLE_CONFIG_LIST_JSON}'
```

- Place `user/` at `{USER_DIRECTORY_DEFAULT}` on every worker (or anywhere, plus
  `HFLOW_USER_DIR`).

## 3. Environment the DAG expects

| variable | value | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HFLOW_USER_DIR` | absolute path of `user/` on the workers | where the tasks import `{pipeline_filename}` from (default `{USER_DIRECTORY_DEFAULT}`) |
{passthrough_environment_rows}

Data root: episode URIs in the trigger conf resolve under
`{config.data_root_uri}`. Construct your pipeline's App WITHOUT a
`data_root` argument (recommended: the task exports `HFLOW_DATA_ROOT`
before importing your pipeline, so the same file also runs unedited in the
dev loop), or with exactly `data_root="{config.data_root_uri}"` -- the DAG
refuses to process episodes under any other root.

Object-store roots use the optional obstore backend in the task venv and the
provider's standard worker credentials. Each worker spools inputs and outputs
through an etag-validated local mirror (set `HFLOW_MIRROR_DIR` to place it
on suitable ephemeral storage). Absolute paths must be mounted identically on
every worker.

## 4. Trigger an ingest

Trigger the MASTER DAG `{dag_id}`; it fans out to the stage sub-DAGs its
profile enables (run profiles: {profile_names}; `"mode": "online"` is the
latency-first per-episode lane -- one immediate batch, no stagger).

Airflow UI: trigger `{dag_id}` with conf
`{{"uris": ["episodes-in/run_0001.mcap"], "profile": "full", "mode": "batch"}}`.
REST: `POST /api/v2/dags/{dag_id}/dagRuns` with
`{{"logical_date": null, "conf": {{"uris": [...], "profile": "full",
"mode": "batch"}}}}` (Bearer token from `POST /auth/token`).
