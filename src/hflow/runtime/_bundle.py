"""Render the Docker Compose runtime bundle.

``render_bundle`` writes a self-contained directory a user can inspect, edit,
and run with plain ``docker compose`` -- the SDK provisions the runtime, it
never becomes the runtime (Airflow is not a pip dependency; see
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Deployment modes" and references/airflow3-notes.md for
the Airflow 3.3.1 facts this encodes).

Bundle contents:

- ``docker-compose.yaml`` -- the official Airflow 3.3.1 reference compose
  reduced to LocalExecutor: postgres, airflow-init, airflow-apiserver,
  airflow-scheduler, airflow-dag-processor, airflow-triggerer. No redis, no
  celery worker. API bound to ``127.0.0.1:{api_port}`` only. Trap config
  pre-set: dags_are_paused_at_creation=false, load_examples=false,
  object-storage XCom backend (file:// under the data root), DAG bundle list
  pointing at the bundle's ``dags/`` dir.
- ``.env`` -- generated secrets (JWT secret, admin password unless supplied),
  image tags, UID. Regenerating a bundle NEVER overwrites an existing .env
  (create-if-absent: secrets survive re-renders).
- ``dags/`` -- the FIVE generated DAG files (the ingest stage graph): the master
  ``ingest.py`` plus the four sub-DAGs ``ingest_sync.py`` / ``ingest_meta.py``
  / ``ingest_labels.py`` / ``ingest_media.py`` (see below).
- ``user/`` -- a copy of the pipeline file's DIRECTORY (minus environments,
  caches, version-control metadata, and the workspace, which is mounted rather
  than shipped), mounted into the containers, so a pipeline that imports a
  module beside it works.
- ``user-venv`` named volume + an init service that builds the user's venv
  with ``uv`` inside the Airflow image, which ships it on PATH (the
  external-python pattern: user dependencies never meet Airflow's pins). A
  ``uv.lock`` beside the pipeline installs the versions it locked; otherwise a
  ``pyproject.toml``, and a ``requirements.txt`` applies on top either way.
  The venv is rebuilt only when the project/requirements/hflow-source content
  hash changes (a marker file inside the volume is the checkpoint).

The master DAG (the stage graph's master half) runs entirely in Airflow's own
environment: a plain ``@task`` resolves the run profile against a dict
literal baked from :data:`hflow.steps.RUN_PROFILES` at render time; each
stage's ``TriggerDagRunOperator`` sits behind an ``enabled_<stage>`` gate
task that raises ``AirflowSkipException`` when the profile disables it
(deliberately NOT ``@task.branch`` -- see the master template's docstring),
chained sequentially ``sync >> meta >> labels >> media``.

Each sub-DAG (all task callables run via ``@task.external_python`` against
the user venv; every import lives inside the function bodies -- the operator
extracts them to temp files):

1. ``plan``: ``hflow.batching.plan_batches`` over the conf's ``uris``
   (sizes measured under the mounted data root), returning JSON-serializable
   batches with stagger delays; conf mode ``"online"`` instead returns the
   uris as one immediate batch (latency-first, no stagger).
2. ``process_batch`` (dynamically mapped over batches): sleeps its stagger
   delay, imports the user's pipeline module by file path, calls
   ``app.process(uri, stages={<this sub-DAG's stage>})`` per episode, returns
   counts ``{"processed": n, "quarantined": k, "errors": e}``.
3. The gate: sums the counts and fails the run loudly over the budget of
   ``max(8, ceil(1% of total))``. Checks decide quarantine, so
   the quarantine half of the budget lives ONLY in the meta sub-DAG's
   ``quarantine_budget_gate``; every other stage keeps the
   ``error_budget_gate`` half. Quarantine never deletes; the gate only makes
   mass failure visible.
